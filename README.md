# Hypergraph-based Supercompilation

Hypergraph-based supercompilation is a kind of multi-result 
supercompilation based on hypergraph transformation.
This project is a set of components for building such supercompilers,
currently limited to a lazy first-order functional language.
It also contains an experimental supercompiler that can prove equivalence of
functions.
